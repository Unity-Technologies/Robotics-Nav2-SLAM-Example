# Navigation 2 SLAM Example
This example provides a Unity Project and a colcon workspace that, when used together, allows a user to substitute Unity as the simulation environment for the purposes of following the [Navigation 2 SLAM tutorials](https://navigation.ros.org/tutorials/docs/navigation2_with_slam.html). In following the tutorial provided with this example, you will exercise Unity's ROS 2 integration, explore an example environment generated with our [Robotics Warehouse](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Robotics-Warehouse/tree/main) randomizable environment, and learn about ways in which this project could be extended to support a more specific use case or automated to provide continuous integration testing of a robotics navigation stack.
